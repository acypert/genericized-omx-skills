# Ship

This is a short alias for the full Codex feature pipeline skill.

When this skill is triggered, read and follow:

`~/.agents/skills/codex-feature-pipeline/SKILL.md`

Preserve the full subagent-only contract from that skill. The initiating session is only the leader/orchestrator. All substantive workflow stages must be delegated to subagents through the pipeline handoff files.
